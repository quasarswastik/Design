Hi :wave:

My name is Swastik and I'm a software engineer based in Perth, Western Australia. I am currently leading tech implementation for major capital projects' business transformation. I am a software engineer at heart and have an interest in data. 

Here's some of my work experience: <br>
ðŸŒŸ Senior Data & AI Consultant/Engineer at Deloitte <br>
ðŸŒŸ Data Assurance Associate at PwC Australia <br>
ðŸŒŸ AI Applications & User Engagement student at Lions Eye Institute <br>
ðŸŒŸ Content Curator at Cecil Andrews College <br>

I like to volunteer and teach, making tech accessible for all. This is why you can find me at different local industry events and workshops as a volunteer or speaker. âœ¨
