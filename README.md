Hi :wave:

My name is Swastik and I'm a software engineer based in Perth, Western Australia. I am currently leading tech implementation for major capital projects using variety of platforms and tools. I have interest in data however, I am software engineer at heart. Here's some of my past experience:

Work experience:
- Data & AI Consultant at Deloitte
- Data Assurance Associate at PwC Australia
- AI Applications & User Engagement student at Lions Eye Institute
- Content Curator at Cecil Andrews College

I like to volunteer and teach, making tech accessible for all. This is why you can find me at different local industry events and workshops as a volunteer or speaker. Feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/swastikrajchauhan/).
